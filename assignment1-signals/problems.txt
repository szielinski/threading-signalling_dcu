The program uses a cleanup handler to print a message. The problem with this is
that cleanup handlers are meant to be used to free up the resources that a 
thread holds at the time it terminates, e.g. a mutex. Its usage in this program
varies slightly from the usual usage, but it was the only way that we could 
think of to print a message when a deferred cancelation request comes in. 

Errors that may result from the usage of sigwait and pthred_kill are not handled
(when the functions return something other than 0). These errors never occurred
during the process of testing, and additionally they were not covered in CA321,
so they were omitted from this assignment.
