A race condition has arisen when it came to cleaning up after the alarm threads
(the numerous threads that are put on the linked list). The problem revolved 
around the fact that you cannot send a cancellation request to a thread, and 
call pthread_join() on it while holding the mutex. To solve it, the sigWaiter 
thread was changed with some of the responsibility for cleaning up after those 
threads being shifted over to the main, which does not have any mutexes 
associated with it. As things stand, sigWaiter only sends a cancellation 
request, while the main calls pthread_join() and frees the memory off of the 
linked list.
